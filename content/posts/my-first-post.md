# Welcome

Hey all this is my first blog post. The concept of this blog
is to educate and show a glimpse of my day to day. I hope to produce content at
least weekly to get started.

Will be covering different technology aspects centered around DevOps and Cloud
Services. The other will be around general automation tools and services I use
to gear up for an engagement.
