        <p>Hi, my name is David Cunliffe. I have been interested in computers and software since I learned BASIC in the early 1990’s. I took up hobbyist computing and learned about software programming, hardware hacking, BBS’s, and this wonderful thing called electronic mail.</p>
<p>After high school, I became interested in the newly commercialized Internet that promised to change the world. I started my first job working for AOL and CompuServe and have been in and out of IT since. I recently started to do consulting a few years back and web hosting in the early days of the Internet. The Internet has indeed changed the world since those early days in the 90’s. Along the way, I’ve worked for all manner of businesses as both an employee and a consultant, providing advice, mentoring, and software programming services. I have had a great time so far, and I am looking forward to what comes next. I hope the things that I post here help you with your journey.</p>
<p>I specialize in designing and building infrastructure using a variety of technologies and cloud based platforms. You can see a small sampling of my skills and experience right here in my blog. I provide technology and software consulting services through 2nd Watch, Inc to which opinions are my own and not the views of my employer. If you are interested in my services, please send me a message and I will reply promptly.</p>
